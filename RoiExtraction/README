### RoiExtraction ###

This module processes the training set and extracts the ROI for each image, as needed.
Every type of organ except Whole and Branch is processed since the two contain enough
information about the plant as is.

The module is written in Python and uses OpenCV for image processing and other 3rd
party modules not included in OpenCV, such as Chan-Vese active contour detection.
